- [ ] move to swift
- [ ] grab minimum OS version from app bundle and use when building pkg
- [ ] create dist pkg by default, component as option
- [ ] signing and notarization as options
- [ ] modern compression as option
- [ ] identify shell scripts and build a payload free package
    - problems with this:
    - how to determine if the given file is a script? executable bit? parse the #! ?
    - how to choose id and version? (for true payload free packages, this may not matter since they don't leave a receipt anyway?)
- [ ] use some preference setting to determine default package name syntax
- [ ] support for tar, gzip and bzip
- [ ] ? identify app just by name or id (could use: mdfind "kMDItemKind == 'Application' && kMDItemDisplayName == 'iTunes'")
